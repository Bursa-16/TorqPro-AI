# TorqPro AI

> **AI-powered fastener engineering, deterministic torque recommendation, validation, traceability, and knowledge platform.**

---

## Overview

TorqPro AI is a professional engineering platform for the design, analysis, validation, optimization, and governance of threaded joints and tightening processes.

The platform combines deterministic engineering calculations, validated engineering knowledge, lifecycle management, traceability, and controlled AI-assisted engineering workflows.

The core engineering philosophy is simple:

> **Deterministic engineering calculations remain authoritative. AI is additive, explainable, traceable, and cannot override validated engineering results.**

TorqPro AI is designed to support engineering decision-making without replacing validated engineering logic.

# Engineering Architecture

TorqPro AI separates engineering authority from AI-assisted reasoning.

The architecture is designed around the following principle:

```text
Engineering Input
      │
      ▼
Deterministic Engineering Engine
      │
      ├── Authoritative calculations
      ├── Engineering limits
      ├── Validation rules
      └── Traceable results
      │
      ▼
AI Context / Grounding Layer
      │
      ├── Engineering evidence
      ├── Calculation context
      ├── Approved knowledge
      └── Traceability context
      │
      ▼
AI Provider
      │
      ▼
Evidence / Safety / Explainability
      │
      ▼
Advisory Engineering Explanation
```

The AI layer cannot replace deterministic numeric output.

# AI Engineering Principles

TorqPro AI follows several core engineering rules.

### Deterministic Authority

Validated engineering calculations remain the authoritative source for engineering results.

### AI Is Advisory

AI may explain, contextualize, summarize, or reason from validated engineering information.

It cannot override an authoritative calculation.

### Grounding

AI responses are designed to use controlled engineering context and approved evidence.

### Explainability

Engineering reasoning must remain understandable and traceable.

### Auditability

AI operations are designed to support correlation IDs, audit records, provider metadata, result hashes, and safe error categorization.

### Fail-Closed Behavior

When required engineering evidence or provider capability is unavailable, TorqPro does not fabricate an authoritative result.

---

# AI Provider Architecture (v3.1.0)

TorqPro v3.1.0 includes a governed AI gateway with two optional real
provider implementations. The provider layer is strictly separated from
deterministic engineering logic.

## Provider Abstraction

```
AI Gateway
├─ Ollama local — optional, zero external API fee
│   (requires operator-managed Ollama server and model)
├─ Anthropic — optional paid provider path
│   (requires TORQPRO_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, disabled by default)
└─ deterministic engineering remains authoritative
```

Provider configuration is backend-controlled. Normal users do not see
or select provider names, model identifiers, or API endpoints.

**No automatic local → paid fallback.** Ollama failure raises
`ModelUnavailableError` and stops; it never silently routes to
Anthropic. (`PAID_CLOUD_AUTO_FALLBACK = NO`)

## Ollama Local Provider

* `OllamaModelClient` via `httpx` (no SDK dependency)
* Configured via `TORQPRO_OLLAMA_ENABLED`, `TORQPRO_OLLAMA_BASE_URL`,
  `TORQPRO_OLLAMA_MODEL`, `TORQPRO_OLLAMA_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`,
  `TORQPRO_OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` (default `"10m"`)
* Default model: `qwen3:8b`. One target machine was validated with
  `qwen2.5:3b`; this is not a universal hard-coded product default.
  Local model availability and performance depend on operator hardware.
* Local Ollama inference has **zero external API fee.**
* `MODEL_AUTO_DOWNLOAD = NO` — TorqPro never calls `ollama pull`.
* `MODEL_AUTO_SUBSTITUTION = NO` — missing models are reported, not silently replaced.

## Anthropic Provider

* `AnthropicModelClient` via `httpx` (no SDK dependency)
* Default model: `claude-sonnet-5`; `max_tokens: 16000`
* Disabled by default; requires `TORQPRO_ANTHROPIC_ENABLED=true` and
  `TORQPRO_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set via secure environment injection.
* **Never commit API keys to source control.**

* bounded timeout behavior
* bounded retry handling
* strict response validation
* malformed-response fail-safe behavior

The implementation does not introduce OpenAI-specific logic into deterministic engineering calculations.

---

## OpenAI Configuration

The provider is configured through environment variables:

```text
TORQPRO_OPENAI_API_KEY
TORQPRO_OPENAI_MODEL
TORQPRO_OPENAI_TIMEOUT_S
TORQPRO_OPENAI_MAX_RETRIES
```

`TORQPRO_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `TORQPRO_OPENAI_MODEL` are required for the OpenAI provider to be considered available.

No OpenAI model is hardcoded as the TorqPro product default.

Timeout and retry settings use bounded behavior.

---

# Provider Transport Layer

External AI network communication is isolated through a provider-agnostic transport layer.

The transport layer is responsible for:

* HTTP requests
* timeout enforcement
* bounded retry behavior
* transient-error handling
* safe transport exceptions

It contains no TorqPro engineering calculation logic.

Retry behavior is restricted to transient failures such as:

* connection errors
* timeout errors
* HTTP `429`
* selected HTTP `5xx` responses

Normal non-429 `4xx` responses are not automatically retried.

---

# Privacy and Provider Safety

The external provider integration is designed to avoid accidental exposure of sensitive runtime information.

The provider/transport layer does not intentionally log or persist:

* API keys
* Authorization headers
* raw provider error bodies
* raw prompts through the transport layer
* raw provider responses through the transport layer

Existing TorqPro audit mechanisms retain only safe metadata according to the platform's audit architecture.

---

# Torque Recommendation Engine

The deterministic Torque Recommendation Engine evaluates engineering inputs and produces controlled torque recommendations.

The engine is designed around:

* deterministic calculations
* explicit engineering limits
* traceable recommendation logic
* controlled validation
* fail-closed behavior
* audit support

AI cannot replace the deterministic recommendation.

AI may be used later to explain an already validated recommendation.

---

# Engineering Reasoning Engine

The Engineering Reasoning Engine builds explainable reasoning around deterministic engineering results.

Its purpose is to answer:

* What was calculated?
* Why was this recommendation produced?
* Which engineering evidence supports it?
* What requires engineering validation?
* What assumptions or constraints are relevant?

The reasoning layer does not become the source of authoritative numeric engineering output.

---

# Grounding and Evidence

TorqPro's AI architecture includes controlled grounding and evidence checking.

The pipeline is designed around:

```text
Permission
   ↓
Context Builder
   ↓
Retrieval
   ↓
Optional Engineering Tools
   ↓
AI Provider
   ↓
Evidence Checker
   ↓
Composer
   ↓
Audit
```

Grounding and evidence validation remain provider-independent.

---

# Audit and Traceability

TorqPro AI includes persistent audit infrastructure for AI-assisted workflows.

Audit capabilities include controlled metadata such as:

* correlation ID
* provider identity
* model identifier
* success/failure state
* latency
* safe error category
* response hash where applicable

Raw secrets are not part of the audit contract.

# Known Limitation

No live OpenAI API request was executed during sandbox validation.

The external provider integration was validated using mocked HTTP transport with zero live external network calls.

Live provider validation requires:

* valid OpenAI credentials
* configured `TORQPRO_OPENAI_MODEL`
* network access to the OpenAI API
* deployment-environment validation

This limitation does not affect the deterministic TorqPro engineering calculation layer.

---

# Release Integrity

The `v3.1.0-alpha.1` release was validated using:

* full repository bundle
* clean bundle-clone verification
* release patch
* independent patch-application verification
* tree-hash equivalence
* SHA256 artifact verification
* full test-suite execution from a clean bundle clone

The validated release tree hash is:

```text
455ff7e05fd02eaafc1a8362161350a57d5c0e9a
```

AI capability is developed around the deterministic engineering system rather than replacing it.

---

# Engineering Principle

> **Calculate deterministically. Reason from evidence. Explain transparently. Preserve traceability.**

---

# Release Philosophy

TorqPro development follows a controlled release process:

```text
Scope Discovery
      ↓
Architecture / Risk Review
      ↓
Implementation
      ↓
Targeted Validation
      ↓
Full Regression Validation
      ↓
Release Metadata
      ↓
Commit / Tag
      ↓
Bundle / Patch Verification
      ↓
Release
```

New AI capabilities must preserve deterministic engineering authority and must pass existing engineering safety, dependency-direction, and regression safeguards before release.

---

**TorqPro AI — Engineering first. AI where it adds controlled, explainable value.**
