"""TorqPro AI Gateway - AI model client abstraction.

Faz v3.0.0-alpha.1 (AI Architecture Foundation), per ADR-0017 Karar 4
("AI provider abstraction yapisi").

Naming note (deliberate, per ADR-0017 Karar 4): this module's
abstraction is named ``AIModelClient``, never ``Provider``.
``backend.calculation_engine.provider.Provider`` is the existing,
unrelated abstraction for deterministic engineering-calculation
providers (e.g. ``VDI2230Provider``). The two concepts must never be
merged, aliased or made to share a base class -- doing so would blur
exactly the deterministic/AI boundary ADR-0017 exists to keep sharp.

``PromptContext`` and ``ModelResponse`` follow the same immutable-
dataclass design philosophy as
``backend.calculation_engine.request.CalculationRequest``/
``response.CalculationResponse``, but are entirely separate types
with no import relationship to those modules -- one pair is a
deterministic engineering calculation contract, the other is a model-
completion contract, and they are never interchanged.

No concrete, network-calling ``AIModelClient`` subclass is defined in
this phase (ADR-0017 Karar 4 / Karar 12: "ilk implementasyon fazında
oluşturulmayan dosyalar" explicitly excludes ``backend/ai_gateway/
providers/*``). ``FakeModelClient`` below is a deterministic,
in-process test double only -- it makes no network call, requires no
API key and is not a "real" AI provider.
