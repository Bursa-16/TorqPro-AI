"""TorqPro AI Gateway - Question Bank retrieval adaptor.

Faz v3.0.0-alpha.1 (AI Architecture Foundation) + Faz v3.0.0-alpha.2
(AI Retrieval & Grounding), per ADR-0017 Karar 3 and ADR-0018.

Hard rule (ADR-0017 Karar 3 / ADR-0018 Karar 2, restated here for
reviewer visibility): this module calls **only**
``backend.question_bank.service``/``backend.question_bank.retrieval``
public functions. It never imports ``backend.question_bank.store``
(the raw SQLite access layer) and never writes a ``SELECT``/filter of
its own against the ``question_bank_records`` table. The "only
validated content is visible to AI" rule is therefore enforced by the
exact same, already-tested code path the rest of TorqPro uses for
publishable-question visibility -- ``validator.validate_publishable``,
reached here only indirectly through
``service.get_publishable_questions`` and
``retrieval.list_questions(..., publishable_only=True)``, never
reimplemented.

ADR-0018 Karar 2's exact usage boundary (statically enforced by
``tests/ai/test_question_bank_adapter.py``):

    - ``list_questions`` is **always** called with
      ``publishable_only=True``. This module never passes
      ``publishable_only=False``.
    - ``validation_status=`` is **never** passed to ``list_questions``
      (that parameter is only meaningful when
      ``publishable_only=False``, which this module never uses -- see
      above).
    - ``include_deleted``/``include_archived`` are never set to
      ``True``.

Because ``publishable_only=True`` funnels every result through
``validate_publishable()`` -- which returns ``False`` for ``draft``,
``technical_review``, ``rejected`` *and* ``deprecated`` records
regardless of their JSON ``is_active`` flag (see that function's own
docstring) -- this adaptor never sees, and therefore can never
surface, any of those four lifecycle states as AI evidence. This
module does not implement that exclusion itself; it inherits it
entirely from the existing, already-tested Question Bank lifecycle
guarantee.

This module also never calls any Question Bank *write* function
(``register_question``, ``update_question``, ``validate_question``,
``reject_question``, ``delete_question``, bulk operations, import/
export, etc.) -- the AI layer has no write path into Question Bank,
per ADR-0017 Karar 1 and Karar 3.
