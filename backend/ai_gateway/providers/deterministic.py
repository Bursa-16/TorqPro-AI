"""TorqPro AI Gateway - deterministic/offline-safe provider.

Faz v3.0.0-alpha.5 (Provider Abstraction), per ADR-0020.

Distinct from ``backend.ai_gateway.llm_client.FakeModelClient``:
``FakeModelClient`` is a *test-only* double, constructed ad hoc by
individual tests and by ``tests/ai/test_http_route.py``'s FastAPI
``dependency_overrides`` fixture -- it is never registered anywhere.
``DeterministicModelClient`` is this phase's first concrete,
registry-eligible ``AIModelClient``: still makes no network call and
requires no credential or configuration (so it is always
``is_available() -> True``), but it is meant as a real, explicitly
selectable provider (e.g. for an offline/air-gapped deployment, or as
a safe, always-available registry entry alongside future networked
providers), not a throwaway test fixture. The two classes are
deliberately kept separate rather than merged or aliased, so a test
changing ``FakeModelClient``'s behaviour can never silently change
what ``ProviderRegistry`` exposes to production code, and vice versa.

No real OpenAI/Claude/Ollama integration is added in this phase
(ADR-0020 scope limit, mirrors ``backend.ai_gateway.llm_client``'s own
pre-existing deferral) -- this is the only concrete provider this
phase registers.
