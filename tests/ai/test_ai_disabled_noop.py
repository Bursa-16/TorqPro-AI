"""ADR-0017 Karar 10 -- TorqPro must work completely unaffected by the
presence of the AI layer, whether or not it is wired to an HTTP route.

v3.0.0-alpha.1 through v3.0.0-alpha.3 had no HTTP route and no
``app.py`` change at all (see ADR-0017 Karar 12/13); that "AI disabled"
state was simply "AI has never been wired in". v3.0.0-alpha.4
intentionally wires exactly one read-only HTTP route
(``POST /api/ai/query``, ``backend/api/routes/ai_gateway.py``) into
``backend/app.py`` via the exact same minimal
``import + app.include_router(...)`` pattern already used for every
other route module (``joints``, ``production_validation``,
``question_bank``, ``washer_resolution_closure``). The two tests below
that specifically asserted "no AI route/reference exists yet" are
updated accordingly, in place, to assert this phase's actual (still
narrow, still additive) scope instead -- every other test in this file
is unchanged and still proves TorqPro's non-AI surface is unaffected.

    just the source-text level. Supersedes the pre-alpha.4 "zero
    /api/ai paths" assertion, which is now intentionally obsolete now
    that v3.0.0-alpha.4 wired in the first such path.

    v3.0.0-alpha.5 (ADR-0020) note: updated in place, following this
    same file's own alpha.4-era precedent (see module docstring) --
    three new, deliberately-scoped read-only paths were added
    (``GET /api/ai/providers``, ``GET /api/ai/audit``,
    ``GET /api/ai/audit/{audit_id}``); no other route was added or
    removed, and the full guarded-path count (4) is asserted
    explicitly so a future, unreviewed fifth route would fail this
    test rather than silently pass.

    v3.0.0-beta.1 note: updated in place again. ``POST
    /api/ai/torque-recommendation`` (``backend/api/routes/
    torque_recommendation.py``) is included in the expected set below
    because it shares the ``/api/ai`` URL prefix this test filters
    on -- not because it comes from ``backend.ai_gateway``. That
    route's own module never imports ``backend.ai_gateway`` (see
    ``tests/torque_recommendation/test_beta1_engine.py::
    test_engine_module_never_imports_ai_gateway``), so its presence
    here does not weaken what this test actually proves: importing
    ``backend.ai_gateway`` registers nothing beyond its own routes.

    v3.0.0-beta.2 note: updated in place again, following this same
    file's own established precedent (see module docstring). One new
    route was added, ``POST /api/ai/engineering-reasoning``
    (``backend/api/routes/ai_gateway.py``, the Engineering Reasoning
    Engine's sole HTTP entry point) -- it *does* come from
    ``backend.ai_gateway`` (specifically
    ``backend.ai_gateway.reasoning``), unlike
    ``/api/ai/torque-recommendation`` above.

    AI-RECOVERY-B3 note: one further route added,
    ``POST /api/ai/question-bank/search`` (retrieval-only, no provider
    call, publishable-only QB keyword search).

    AI-B5 note: one further route added,
    ``POST /api/ai/question-bank/explain`` (generative, provider-backed
    approved-QB-record explain endpoint). The guarded-path count is
    now explicitly 8."""
