"""Faz 2.8.10 Stage 2 -- shared pytest fixtures (tests/conftest.py).

Validates the three opt-in, additive fixtures introduced in Stage 2
(``client``, ``auth_headers``, ``login_as``) that generalize the
previously per-file-duplicated TestClient/login boilerplate identified
in the Stage 1 Quality Gap Report (Sec. 2.2): 25 of the ~85 existing
test files hardcoded the admin credential and 16 independently defined
a local ``auth()``/``token()`` helper.

This file does not modify, replace, or depend on any existing test
file's local helpers -- it only exercises the new shared fixtures on
their own, proving they behave exactly like the pattern already
established in tests/production_validation/conftest.py and
tests/test_faz_2_8_9_stage3_api.py (module-scoped ``auth_headers``
wrapping the same ``/api/login`` call), just available at the suite
root instead of being re-derived per file.
