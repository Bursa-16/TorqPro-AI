"""v3.0.0-rc.1 Performance & Reliability -- targeted regression /
reliability tests.

Part of the normal ``pytest -q`` run (unlike ``tests/performance/``,
which is opt-in) -- every test here is a deterministic pass/fail
correctness check, never a timing assertion, so it belongs in the
regular suite per this phase's own "yeni testler deterministic olmalı
/ timing-flaky test yazma" requirement.

Covers:

* P2 -- SQLite WAL + busy_timeout (``backend/app.py``'s ``conn()``):
  WAL is actually active on a real, file-backed database; normal CRUD
  is unaffected; a concurrent read/write smoke scenario produces no
  errors and no data loss/corruption.
* Reliability -- repeated calculation creation, concurrent project/
  calculation reads, concurrent writes, audit-log persistence,
  deterministic-engine repeated-call consistency, provider-independent/
  offline AI behavior under repeated requests, DB reopen/reconnect,
  and a failure/retry path (a deliberately malformed request retried
  after a valid one, proving one request's failure never corrupts
  state for the next).
